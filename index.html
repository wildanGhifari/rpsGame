            <p class="desc">Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as roshambo or ro-sham-bo)[1][2][3] is a hand game usually played between two people. But, this time you'll play againts Computer, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a
            closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a
            V).</p>
